# chess
Just a standard chess game...



Things to updgrade:
1) stalemate feature not implemented yet
2) in order to move a piece (and take the opponent's piece), you have to click near the border (but still, within the demanded checker)
3) RWD
4) List of moves should indicate B4/A8/C7/etc. not numbers

Things to keep in mind:
1) The project neeeds hosting on a server in order to work
2) The buttons: "do tylu", "do przodu" are only to peek the previous moves. They don't allow to modify any moves!
3) The same goes for list of moves (can be only used to see the previous moves; not to modify them)
4) To modify some moves, use "cofnij" button and move a piece differently
